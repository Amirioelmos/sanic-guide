# Introduction

::: warning UNDER CONSTRUCTION  
These documents are still under construction. Ultimately they will replace the docs at readthedocs, and that page will be strictly API documentation. Any suggestions or support will be welcome [at the repo](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic-guide) or [on the forums](https://community.sanicframework.org/t/frontpage-and-documentation-overhaul/770).

Final version expected to conincide with 21.3 release.  

*Updated January 2021*
:::

Sanic is a Python 3.6+ web server and web framework thatâ€™s written to go fast. It allows the usage of the async/await syntax added in Python 3.5, which makes your code non-blocking and speedy.

## What is it?

First things first, before you jump in the water, you should know that Sanic is different than other frameworks.

Right there in that first sentence there is a huge mistake because Sanic is _both_ a **framework** and a **web server**. In the deployment section we will talk a little bit more about this. 

But, remember, out of the box Sanic comes with everything you need to write, deploy, and scale a production grade web application. :rocket:

## Goal

> To provide a simple way to get up and running a highly performant HTTP server that is easy to build, to expand, and ultimately to scale.
## Features

---:1

- Built in _fast_ web server
- Production ready
- Highly scalable
- ASGI compliant
- Simple and intuitive API design
- By the community, for the community
